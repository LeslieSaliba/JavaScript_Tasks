    <p>let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is usually
        denoted by curly braces {}.</p>

    <p>var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
        variables are available throughout your entire code.</p>

    <p>const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that can’t be reassigned.
        Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
        variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</p>
